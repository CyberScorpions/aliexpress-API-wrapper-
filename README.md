# aliexpress-API-wrapper-



Hi guys, this is a wrapper for aliexpress API, that support all of it's basic functions. 


The wrapper is based on the Aliexpress official Docs:
            http://portals.aliexpress.com/help/help_center_API.html


The wrapper basic function are:

```
listPromotionProduct()

getPromotionProductDetail()

getPromotionLinks()
```

see the docs for more details. (parameters etc.)

i made some global vars that are related to all the api calls:

```
commissionRateFrom = 0.04

commissionRateTo = 0.9

pageSize = 40
```
while pagesize max value is 40.

Few fixes and error handling is needed!
